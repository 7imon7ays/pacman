# Todo

## Logic
* Block moving objects longitudinally.
* Figure out why initializer assignments aren't getting inherited.

## Aesthetic
* Design ghosts.
* Pick ghost color.
* Don't let player try to join room without picking color.
* Don't let player pick color that's already taken.
* Let player pick from hex table or input custom hex?
